# SUMMARY
UISCEmod: Software for modelling and characterizing water level time series focused
on ephemeral karstic wetlands from Ireland. UISCEmod includes two hydrological models, 
empirical (EM) and lumped (LM), that requires minimal input information 
(meteorological, water levels, and volume-stage-area curves). The calibration process for both 
modelling approaches is automated following a Bayesian approach. 

UISCEmod is divided in Input,Calibration and Outputs modules.
The Inputs module combines meteorological datasets, R and ETo, to generate 
ER time series, which are then considered for the hydrological models. 
The calibration module is used to calibrate the hydrological models and 
can be ignored if model parameters are already defined. The third module, 
Outputs, generates the products including: forward solution for stage and 
volume time series, probability density function (pdf) of the calibrated model 
parameters, and a set of products to help evaluating convergence of the 
calibration process as well as the fit of the data. 

######
General code structure
######
The main functions used by UISCEmod_v072023 are in the UISCEmod_library_v072023
UISCEmod is divided in three modules:
    Inputs: UISCEmod_module_inputs.py
    Calibration: UISCEmod_module_calibration.py
    Outputs: UISCEmod_module_outputs.py
